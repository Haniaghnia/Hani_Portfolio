## Machine Learning Project : Lending company risk prediction

### Project Background
One of the risks that credit card financing companies experience is having problems with customers who are unable or unwilling to pay their credit card installments. This can lead to high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs), which can reduce a company's profits and increase the risk of loss. In this case how to increase the number of current consumers and reduce or reject potential customers who have a high chance of experiencing a risk of default. As a data scientist maximizes data to predict the payment ability of their consumers, thus ensuring customers who are able to make repayments are not rejected when applying for a loan, and reject loan applications with consumers who have a high risk of default

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and summarizing data sets to understand their features, patterns, and relationships. This step identifies potential issues or problems with the data, such as missing values, outliers, or incorrect data types.
 
### Modeling
Using Random Forest algorithm for modeling and to measure model performance of credit risk using AUC and KS.

### Result :
Model produces performance `AUC = 0.857` and `KS = 0.56`. In credit risk modeling, generally AUC above 0.7 and KS above 0.3 is a good performance.
