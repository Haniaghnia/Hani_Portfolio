### About Project 
- Client/Company: Indonesian Ministry of Transportation (MARITIMHUB)  
- Project Duration: One Year 
- Objective: To Integrate Maritime Data and Visualize Key Operational Metrics.  

### Project Overview
This project aimed to improve the quality and accessibility of data within the MaritimHUB Integrated Data Service Portal. As a key member of the data analyst team, I played a crucial role in developing a robust data infrastructure and providing valuable insights to stakeholders. 

###  Tools & Technologies Used:  
1. **Pentaho**: ETL job creation and data normalization.
2. **DBeaver SQL** : Data extraction and management. 
3. **Apache Superset**: Dashboard development and data visualization. 

### Objectives
1. **Establish Data Quality Standards**: Define and implement data quality checks and validation rules to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and consistency. 
2. **Develop Data Warehouse Architecture**: Design and implement a data warehouse architecture, including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, to efficiently store and manage large volumes of data. 
3. **Enhance Data Accessibility**: Create user-friendly dashboards and reports to provide stakeholders with easy access to key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights.
4. **Support User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Prepare and manage UAT data, ensuring data feasibility, accuracy, and ease of accessibility for testing purposes.

### My Role & Responsibilities
1. **Data Quality Assurance**: Developed and implemented data quality checks and validation rules to ensure data accuracy and consistency across all data sources. 
2. **ETL Process Development**: Designed and implemented ETL processes using Pentaho to extract, transform, and load data from various sources into the data warehouse. 
3. **Data Warehouse Design**: Participated in the design and implementation of the data warehouse architecture, including data normalization and schema design.
4. **Dashboard and Report Development**: Created interactive dashboards and reports in Apache Superset to visualize key metrics and provide actionable insights to stakeholders.
5. **UAT Data Preparation**: Prepared and managed UAT data, ensuring its accuracy, completeness, and compliance with testing requirements.
6. **Collaboration**: Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, including IT, business analysts, and end-users, to understand their data needs and ensure project success.

### Key Achievements
1. Successfully integrated data from 29 applications into a unified data warehouse. And successfully implemented ETL processes that improved data loading speed by up to 20% 
2. Developed and implemented data quality checks that reduced data errors by quantifying reduction, up to 15%. 
3. Created interactive dashboards that provided real-time insights into key maritime operations, enabling data-driven decision-making and improved operational visibility and efficiency. 
4. Successfully supported the UAT process, ensuring timely and accurate data availability for testing. 
5. Contributed to the successful launch and ongoing operation of the MaritimHUB Integrated Data Service Portal. And established data governance practices ensuring high data quality and consistency. 

### Impact 
1. Enhanced data accuracy and streamlined access to maritime data, improving decision-making processes. 
2. Increased efficiency and  effectiveness in data handling, reducing manual processing time significantly.  
3. Provided stakeholders with timely and accurate information to support their operational and strategic needs. 
4. Improved transparency by providing real-time dashboards for monitoring maritime operations and performance metrics. 
5. Supported the digital transformation of Indonesia’s maritime services, contributing to better governance and resource management.
