* Analyze Coffee Shop's business development, especially for new products, and how to improve the new products. The data is processed using SQL queries to explore the data, and using Tableau for visualization.
* There are many ways to perform EDA, one of which is by conducting Univariate, BI variate and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, it is sharpened by sales analysis to    create a Product Drill Down visualization which aims to find out which products have good sales performance, whenever the product is purchased a lot, which product categories are sold the most and at which outlets are the best sales.
* Customer habits and customer profiles are important factors in determining the improvement strategy for sales. In this section we look at the gender, loyalty, and age range of customers who are more likely to try new products. Monitoring customer behavior to find out when we should recommend new products and to what kind of customers for product offerings.

* Using SQL Queries first to pre-process data such as removing outliers, making price rounding calculations, and creating new columns that can be used to help correlation analysis for each variable.
