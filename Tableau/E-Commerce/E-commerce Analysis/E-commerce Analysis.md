#### About data
Brazilian e-commerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing orders from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment, and freight performance to customer location, product attributes, reviews written by customers, and geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/long coordinates.

1. Customer trends:

RFM Segmentation
* Can't lose: These are customers who have recently purchased (Recency = 1) and have spent a lot of money (Frequency = 4). They are the most valuable customers and should be prioritized for marketing and retention efforts.
* Champion: These are customers who have recently purchased (Recency = 1) and have spent a moderate amount of money (Frequency = 3). They are also valuable customers and should be targeted with marketing efforts.
* Lost: These are customers who have not purchased recently (Recency = 4) and have not spent much money (Frequency = 1). They are at risk of churning and should be targeted with reactivation campaigns.
* Need Attention: These are customers who have not purchased recently (Recency = 3) but have spent a moderate amount of money (Frequency = 3). They may be losing interest and should be targeted with marketing efforts to keep them engaged.
* Potential champion: These are customers who have not purchased recently (Recency = 2) but have spent a lot of money (Frequency = 4). They have the potential to be high-value customers and should be targeted with marketing efforts to encourage them to become champions.
* Sleepers: These are customers who have purchased recently (Recency = 1) but have not spent much money (Frequency = 2). They may be new customers and should be monitored to see if they become more active.
* Warm lead: These are customers who have not purchased recently (Recency = 4) but have spent a moderate amount of money (Frequency = 3). They may be interested in your products or services and should be targeted with marketing efforts to convert them into customers.
